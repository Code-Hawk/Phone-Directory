Hello All,

Welcome to my github repository. This repository is an implementation 
of Telephone directory using C++.

Internally the code uses linked list datastruture and implements 
merge sort for sorting them. I have also implemented Trie data
structure, but which is efficient in terms of predicting the closed match contacts.

The project has been going on. Many new features to be added. Also, planning to add
a graphical interface for the same.

Keep tuned!!
